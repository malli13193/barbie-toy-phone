  Button
  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED)
  connected to digital  pin 13, when pressing a
  pushbutton attached to pin 2.

   The circuit:
  * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
  * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
  * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED
  on the board  attached to pin 13.
